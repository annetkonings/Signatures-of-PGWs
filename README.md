# Signatures-of-PSGWs

These three files together compute the relative spectral energy density of primordial stochastic gravitational waves, GWs that originate from quantum fluctuations in the early universe.
The GWs are enhanced by inflation and become so large, that they cross the horizon. Outside the horizon their amplitudes remain constant as there is no causal contact anymore. At some point the horizon gets larger than the gravitational waves, with the large wavenumbers re-entering the horizon first. Once inside, the amplitude of teh GWs is changed due to the particles decoupling from the thermal bath. This is imprinted on the GWs and could potentially be measured by gravitational wave detectors.
